### Project1 "A Web Design Company-Vincique"

This is my first web page that i have built, building projects are definitely good way for learning a skills in a short period of time.
Its been a learning experience for me working on my first bootcamp project to build a web design company, it is actually my second idea after i found out my first idea to build a web page about life hacks failed.
What i understand most of the hack related contents are written by online Columnists getting permission to post their content on my web page will be a bottleneck & challenge as i will need alot of hack contents to populate my web page for a good informative webpage so its not feasible for my current skill level.
now i need to focus to build more websites to improve my skills & speed on building a webpage fast.

Vincique is about a web design company in a one web page layout seems to be the trend for most websites now. 
Users/potential clients can navigate to the desire section from the top naviagtion bar sections consist of services that the company provides,
a section that showcase its portfolio to potential clients and contact page for clients to further their interest with Vincique.
